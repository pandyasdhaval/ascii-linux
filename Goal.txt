Game Challenge 4: 2D game simulator

Either create a new game or modify your ASCII Rougelike to be a 2D combat simulator!

Basic Requirements:

1. Load a level file that specifies two or more arimes of units
2. Store all the troops for each army in a vector of pointers
3. Use 2D vector of chars ( or vector of strings ) for the board like before, but 
   also include a 2D vector of pointer to the troops so you can tell which soldier exists 
   at each spot in the grid
4. Simulate the battle one frame at a time . Use simple ( or complex ) AI to make the 
   troops all kill each other! A simple example of AI would be for each soldier to 
   find the closest enemy and, then move towards it to attack it
5. Make sure to delete any memory you allocate with new before the program ends

Further improvements:

6. Add different kinds of soldiers,	like ranged units or horsemen that can move 2 
   spaces in 1 turn
7. Use system time to simulate the game at certain speed. ( You will have to 
   google this, its different based on your OS)
8. Figure out how to give color characters in the command prompt and give each army its 
   own color!
